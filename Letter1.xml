<salute>Dear Tressy,</salute>

<p>
I didn't start one of those weird notes, because there isn't much to write about, only snakes have killed two here already. Frances and Marilyn are having a shower for Ethel, at Frances William's home, I ask Marilyn why they didn't have it at the church. (Supprise) I'm stoping now I'll start a note so I can have more for you. Say hello to Sarah.</p>
